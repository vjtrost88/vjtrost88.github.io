# [](#header-1)About Me

I am a senior from Pittsburgh in the Applied Data Sciences major at Penn State University. I've been interested in Data Science since my freshman year of college, and did everything I could to take relevant classes before the major was created in the Fall of 2016. I transferred Penn State Campuses (from Erie to University Park) for the Data Science major and couldn't be happier. If I'm not working on Data Science related things, I'm either lifting, playing hockey or volleyball, or hanging out with friends. The Pittsburgh Penguins are back to back Stanley Cup Champions!  

This will be a place where I will post all relevant coursework and projects. Please feel free to reach me at [vincentjosephtrost@gmail.com](vincentjosephtrost@gmail.com).

### [](#header-3) [Clustering Uber Pickups using Spark](https://vjtrost88.github.io/clusteringUberDS410.pdf)

This project was done in conjunction with a class I had in the Spring of 2017 at PSU called DS 410- Programming Models for Data Analytics at Scale. We utilized the school's Hadoop cluster to run Spark programs. My partner, Kevin Baik and I, decided to cluster Uber pickups from the greater NYC area to see if we could identify popular pickup areas. Be sure to check out the [interactive visualization](https://vjtrost88.github.io/uberViz.html) and the [repo](https://github.com/Konnoke/DS410) for the project.

### [](#header-3) [Scraping Craigslist with R into MongoDB](https://vjtrost88.github.io/MongoProject.html)

I did this project for a class Ii had in the Fall of 2016 called DS 220- Data Management for Data Sciences. We learned about a bunch of different NoSQL databases, and our final project was to come up with an original implementation that utilized a database we worked with in class. This is similar to the [Python repo](https://github.com/vjtrost88/Craigslist-Deal-Finder/) I have for scraping Craigslist, but I decided to use R for this one. Working with `rvest` as opposed to `requests` and `beautifulsoup` was good experience to have.

### [](#header-3) [Exploratory Data Analysis on Bike Sharing in DC](https://vjtrost88.github.io/HW02.html)

This EDA was done as a homework assignment for a class I had called STAT 380- Data Science and Computational Reasoning in R. Truthfully, this was the best assignment before the professor dialed it back in terms of difficulty (due to popular complaint). I enjoy these types of projects because you get to be creative on not only the questions you ask of the data, but how you answer them too. I got to test out some different but effective visualization techniques in `ggplot`, and I was pretty happy with how the assignment came out.

### [](#header-3) [Exploring Baby Names Data](https://vjtrost88.github.io/HW_10.html)

This was one of the first assignments I did in the Fall of 2016 during STAT 184- Introduction to R. I had programmed in R before this class, but nothing significant ever came of it. I thought R was relatively hard to pick up, even though I hadn't spent much time on it. This class, though it was only one day a week, made learning it so accessible and fun to do. Huge props to Dr. Matt Beckman who taught it, and the text- Data Computing by Daniel Kaplan. The text and class took a modern approach to R, teaching newer packages like `tidyr` and `dplyr` and staying away from Base R to begin with. Having gained a familiarity with the language that way first allowed me to ease into it better I think.

### [](header-3) [Exploring NHL Hockey Data](https://vjtrost88.github.io/Hockey.html)

As professed earlier, I'm a huge hockey guy. Been around the game my whole life. So as you could imagine, as I was starting out I was dying to get my hands on some hockey data. I found some and played with it for my final project in STAT 184. It's a pretty elementary exploration, with an inexperienced attempt at creating a decision tree at the end, but nonetheless it was fun, and Dr. Beckman actually used it at a Statistical Teaching conference to demonstrate what people can do with an introductory class in R.
