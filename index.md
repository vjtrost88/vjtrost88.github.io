# [](#header-1)About Me

I am a senior from Pittsburgh in the Applied Data Sciences major at Penn State University. I've been interested in Data Science since my freshman year of college, and did everything I could to take relevant classes before the major was created in the Fall of 2016. I transferred Penn State Campuses (from Erie to University Park) for the Data Science major and couldn't be happier. If I'm not working on Data Science related things, I'm either lifting, playing hockey or volleyball, or hanging out with friends. The Pittsburgh Penguins are back to back Stanley Cup Champions!  

This will be a place where I will post all relevant coursework and projects. Please feel free to reach me at [vincentjosephtrost@gmail.com](vincentjosephtrost@gmail.com).

### [](#header-3) [Course2Vec: Course Embeddings are Incredibly Useful](https://vjtrost88.github.io/trost-Course2Vec Course Embeddings are Incredibly Useful-Poster.pdf)  

I worked with my boss Drew Wham's course embeddings in NLTK to run interesting machine learning tasks on the learned embeddings. Being at PSU in the Teaching and Learning with Technology Department, we have access to a plethora of student data, and one of those datasets is a complete record of the sequence of courses every student has taken at Penn State. We can embed these courses using the context around the order in which students take them. Think of the courses as words, the sequences per semester as sentences, and the overall sequence for a student as a document. Given hundreds of thousands of these overall sequences, we can come up with numeric representations of courses that allow us to capture very subtle relationships between them. With this capability, we can come up with a recommendation system for students to take courses when scheduling their next semester.  


### [](#header-3) [Clickbait Detection](https://vjtrost88.github.io/clickbait.nb.html)

We were given a dataset of clickbait articles for our first project in DS 310. Our professor, Dongwon Lee, obtained a research grant from the NSF to research Fake News, and this clickbait dataset was a smaller problem he gave us as a class to tackle. Tackling this NLP problem was valuable experience in getting my feet wet with different types of NLP techniques. The project only lasted 3 weeks, so my learning time was limited, but I came to get a basic understanding of how information is derived from text. The notebook I made is linked above.

### [](#header-3) [Pairs Trading Case Study](https://vjtrost88.github.io/Pairs_Trading.html)  

This project comes from a textbook called **Data Science in R: A Case Studies Approach to Computational Reasoning and Problem Solving**. I'm very interested in using machine learning and other statistical techniques to mitigate risk in investing. Working through this textbook example was great in getting my feet wet with algorithmic trading. My two internships have been at a Mutual Fund company and a Financial Technology firm respectively, so I've been around Finance for a little bit. The idea of using solid statistical methods to make unbiased decisions that create profit in an automated fashion is something I'm very interested in learning more about.

### [](#header-3) [Clustering Uber Pickups using Spark](https://vjtrost88.github.io/clusteringUberDS410.pdf)

This project was done in conjunction with a class I had in the Spring of 2017 at PSU called DS 410- Programming Models for Data Analytics at Scale. We utilized the school's Hadoop cluster to run Spark programs. My partner, Kevin Baik and I, decided to cluster Uber pickups from the greater NYC area to see if we could identify popular pickup areas. Be sure to check out the [interactive visualization](https://vjtrost88.github.io/uberViz.html) and the [repo](https://github.com/Konnoke/DS410) for the project.

### [](#header-3) [Scraping Craigslist with R into MongoDB](https://vjtrost88.github.io/MongoProject.html)

I did this project for a class I had in the Fall of 2016 called DS 220- Data Management for Data Sciences. We learned about a bunch of different NoSQL databases (including MongoDB, Redis, Neo4j, Cassandra, Google BigTable, and more...). Our final project was to come up with an original implementation that utilized a database we worked with in class. This is similar to the [Python repo](https://github.com/vjtrost88/Craigslist-Deal-Finder/) I have for scraping Craigslist, but I decided to use R for this one. Working with `rvest` as opposed to `requests` and `beautifulsoup` was good experience to have.

### [](#header-3) [Exploratory Data Analysis on Bike Sharing in DC](https://vjtrost88.github.io/HW02.html)

This EDA was done as a homework assignment for a class I had called STAT 380- Data Science and Computational Reasoning in R. Truthfully, this was the best assignment before the professor dialed it back in terms of difficulty (due to popular complaint). I enjoy these types of projects because you get to be creative on not only the questions you ask of the data, but how you answer them too. I got to test out some different but effective visualization techniques in `ggplot`, and I was pretty happy with how the assignment came out.

### [](#header-3) [Spotting Trends in State College Temperature Data](https://vjtrost88.github.io/hw6.html)

I did this as the last two assignments in STAT 380. They built on each other, so make sure to check [this](https://vjtrost88.github.io/HW07.html) one as well. We did an exploratory data analysis on temperature data from the State College and Ann Arbor areas. It was interesting to visualize different patterns amongst the areas, and see the variability amongst the months. Along with that, we did some basic language processing that was intended to be built upon to create our own Naive Bayes spam email classifier, but being the first time the class was offered, it unfortunately didn't get there. Maybe I'll have to finish it sometime...

### [](header-3) [Exploring NHL Hockey Data](https://vjtrost88.github.io/Hockey.html)

As professed earlier, I'm a huge hockey guy - been around the game my whole life. So as you could imagine, as I was starting out I was dying to get my hands on some hockey data. I found some and played with it for my final project in STAT 184. It's a pretty elementary exploration, with an inexperienced attempt at creating a decision tree at the end, but nonetheless it was fun, and Dr. Beckman actually used it at a Statistical Teaching conference to demonstrate what people can do with an introductory class in R.
