# [](#header-1)About Me

I am a senior from Pittsburgh in the Applied Data Sciences major at Penn State University. I've been interested in Data Science since my freshman year of college, and did everything I could to take relevant classes before the major was created in the Fall of 2016. I transferred Penn State Campuses (from Erie to University Park) for the Data Science major and couldn't be happier. If I'm not working on Data Science related things, I'm either lifting, playing hockey or volleyball, or hanging out with friends. The Pittsburgh Penguins are back to back Stanley Cup Champions!  

This will be a place where I will post all relevant coursework and projects. Please feel free to reach me at [vincentjosephtrost@gmail.com](vincentjosephtrost@gmail.com).

### [](#header-3) [Clustering Uber Pickups using Spark](https://vjtrost88.github.io/clusteringUberDS410.pdf)

This project was done in conjunction with a class at PSU called DS 410- Programming Models for Data Analytics at Scale. We utilized the school's Hadoop cluster to run Spark programs. My partner, Kevin Baik and I, decided to cluster Uber pickups from the greater NYC area to see if we could identify popular pickup areas. Be sure to check out the [interactive visualization](https://vjtrost88.github.io/uberViz.html) and the [repo](https://github.com/Konnoke/DS410) for the project.

### [](#header-3) [Scraping Craigslist with R into MongoDB](https://vjtrost88.github.io/MongoProject.html)

I did this project for a class called DS 220- Data Management for Data Sciences. We learned about a bunch of different NoSQL databases, and our final project was to come up with an original implementation that utilized a database we worked with in class. This is similar to the [Python repo](https://github.com/vjtrost88/Craigslist-Deal-Finder/) I have for scraping Craigslist, but I decided to use R for this one. Working with `rvest` as opposed to `requests` and `beautifulsoup` was good experience to have.
