# [](#header-1)About Me

I am a senior from Pittsburgh in the Applied Data Sciences major at Penn State University. I've been interested in Data Science since my freshman year of college, and did everything I could to take relevant classes before the major was created in the Fall of 2016. I transferred Penn State Campuses (from Erie to University Park) for the Data Science major and couldn't be happier. If I'm not working on Data Science related things, I'm either lifting, playing hockey or volleyball, or hanging out with friends. The Pittsburgh Penguins are back to back Stanley Cup Champions!  

This will be a place where I will post all relevant coursework and projects. Please feel free to reach me at [vincentjosephtrost@gmail.com](vincentjosephtrost@gmail.com).

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
